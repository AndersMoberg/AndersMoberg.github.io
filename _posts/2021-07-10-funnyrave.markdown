# Notes from me
I wanted to thank FUNNY RAVE staff (Jab, Six, Beatstar) for letting me on once again. In their last event, the artist **Viravax** had produced an set with a lot of ambient music. It caught my eyes (and ears), so huge special thanks to them for indirectly inspiring Part 1 of my performence. I got the courage to go all-in on ambient drone music.

Part of the intro medley was made long ago for a mixtape that never came to be - inspired by a friend of mine that went into a coma for a small time after an incident. It had an effect on me, and it wanted to express it somehow. Friend in question has recovered since, don't worry.

**I will recommend the Twitch VOD with chat** for the optimal viewing experience. Seperated from the live reaction, the performance is lesser for it. In lieu of the VOD being removed in the future, I will reupload the parts seperately onto Mixcloud / Soundcloud.

The Youtube VOD mirror got hit with a copyright ID and has a small section muted.
Turn on subtitles to see Twitch chat messages. It's a little buggy at the time of writing.
