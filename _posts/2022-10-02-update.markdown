# playlists

I made some music playlists recently for use in an online activity I held. I thought they came together well, so I gave them some cover art and deciced to post them publically on my web zone. Here goes!

# general update

I've wanted to consolidate my **o.h mobes** DJ output into one platform, but figuring that out is just messy and unmotivating... 

I've had a **Mixcloud** profile for long, but it's just felt limiting not being a paid user. I reckon **Youtube** might be better for visibility but copyright strikes has hit me before. Same with **Soundcloud**, actually.

Beyond that, creative work is generally on pause..

 * music producing as **o.h mobes**
 * DJ / mixtape producing (audio + visual) as **o.h mobes**
 * larger free time software developement efforts
 * blogs / videos (!) in the [**TAKE CONTROL**](/take-control/2020/12/04/music.html) series
 * unannounced youtube series

I'm keen to back to these (one in particular) but I need space to clear out and clean out for more important things, both mentally and digitally.

Hoping it's not too long until you see something from me.

Peace
