started writing a longer blogpost about a certain something that i'm doing these days, but it was just incredibly tough to write and not feel embarresed about. i'm still doing it! but i can't just be vulnerable in detail on command... 

the words just weren't coming out. scrap that. it'll try to say what i wanted to, another way.

last time i posted something here, i was alluding to that creative work was on pause. that's been true, but it was especially true just a stone's throw away in time after that last blogpost was posted. in short, any ability to develop myself creatively was muted to silence for a long time.

so with that in the back-view mirror: what i'm working on at current time is "paying the debt of my own past", *which sounds really dramatic!!!* but it really just means that i'm parsing decades of old files and work and deciding what to do with it. 

it's boring work, but i feel strongly that i need to do it. this backlog has ruminated to an extreme amount of sogginess within my skull. i will do what i do best, and turn myself into a recluse goblin for the foreseable future. my spirit's are fairly high these days, and i'm so happy that i've got enough space to just do this now.

BUT! i've not completely stopped creative output. **i have actually been doing dj sets and mixtapes ever since**. you can find them on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/@o.hmobes) and/or
[**Soundcloud**](https://soundcloud.com/oh-mobes). beyond some one-off sets from time to time, i'll be performing at a unannounced online event this summer, so keep your eyes out for that.

i also facilitated the production of a compilation of old tracks from artist **Gangways**! [you can find it on Bandcamp here.](https://ruffien.bandcamp.com/album/collection-2012-2014)

that'll do for now.

i think i'm really invested in the idea that i want to make things that are useful for people, or atleast for myself. 

but i've realized that i'm too sluggish to do so now. even if i don't end up making said things, it's better to prepare myself to act when the time's right.

i hope to see you soon. thanks for reading
