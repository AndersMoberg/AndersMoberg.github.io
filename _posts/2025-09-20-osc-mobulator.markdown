Here's the debut set for **OSC Mobulator** that was performed on a music festival at a Discord server I frequent.

**OSC Mobulator** is the DJ "band" between me and

### general update

Working on this and things surrounding it has been quite intense, especially in August. I'm very happy to have this up, available and done with.

To give you a glimse of my general situation: The upcoming 6 months will induce some change in my life, including a move (in the new year most likely). But I'm immensely positive about the direction of how things are going, atleast on a personal level.

It does mean that I don't entirely know what I can put my time to just yet. I'm on the presidice on changes actually taking effect, and even though I know roughly how things might go, it's not happen just yet. I'm not worried at all, I might just take it slow and do more of the work I talked about in the last post.

I'm hoping to be more ready.. for you, in 2026. God, it is 2026 isn't it. Hmm.
