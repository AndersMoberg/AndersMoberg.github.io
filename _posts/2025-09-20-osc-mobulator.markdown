Here's the debut set for **OSC Mobulator** that was performed on a music festival at a Discord server I frequent.

**OSC Mobulator** is the DJ "band" between me and

### general update

Working on this and things surrounding it has been quite intense, especially in August. I'm very happy to have this up, available and done with.

To give you a glimse of my general situation: The upcoming 6 months will induce some change in my life, including a move (in the new year most likely). This is, for real, actually going to kick off starting tomorrow as I write this (with the weather forecasted to have the temperature go down in lieu of autumn, the very next day. Enviromental story-telling!). But I'm immensely positive about the direction of how things are going, atleast on a personal level.

Since I'm on the presidice on changes actually taking effect, I'm thinking that for the foreseeable future I might just take it slow and do more of what I talked about in the last blogpost... or I might just hangout and game or something.

I'm hoping to be more ready.. for you, in 2026. God, it is 2026 isn't it. Hmm.

**One note**: This version of the set is v1.1, which I revealed on September 19th via a DJ stream on Youtube. Due to some issues and mishaps, the DJ stream is unlisted.. if you caught it, you know there is a tease for what I'd like to do with *music* next in there. I shall not say any more. Take it off your mind and don't expect it soon.

*Until next time*

Peace
